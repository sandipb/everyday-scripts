# My Every day scripts

Collection of scripts that I use on my desktops and servers.

Included are:

1. ``laptop-shared-wifi``: Share network connection on your Linux host by
   configuring it as a wifi access point.

## Python scripts

1. ``photo_label.py``: Use the file name in photos to label a folder full of
   them suitable for display on our PixStar photo frame.

## Pre-reqs

brew install bazelisk buildifier
```
